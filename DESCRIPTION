Package: alabaster.schemas
Title: Schemas for the Alabaster Framework
Version: 1.5.0
Date: 2023-11-09
License: MIT + file LICENSE
Description:
    Stores all schemas required by various alabaster.* packages.
    No computation should be performed by this package, as that is handled by alabaster.base.
    We use a separate package instead of storing the schemas in alabaster.base itself,
    to avoid conflating management of the schemas with code maintenence.
